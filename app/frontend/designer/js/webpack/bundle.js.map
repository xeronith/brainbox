Unfortunately, we ran into a bunch of catastrophic backtracking issues\n * with certain input text, causing Autolinker to either hang or just take a\n * really long time to parse the string.\n *\n * The current code is intended to be a O(n) algorithm that walks through\n * the string in one pass, and tries to be as cheap as possible. We don't need\n * to implement the full HTML spec, but rather simply determine where the string\n * looks like an HTML tag, and where it looks like text (so that we can autolink\n * that).\n *\n * This state machine parser is intended just to be a simple but performant\n * parser of HTML for the subset of requirements we have. We simply need to:\n *\n * 1. Determine where HTML tags are\n * 2. Determine the tag name (Autolinker specifically only cares about <a>,\n *    <script>, and <style> tags, so as not to link any text within them)\n *\n * We don't need to:\n *\n * 1. Create a parse tree\n * 2. Auto-close tags with invalid markup\n * 3. etc.\n *\n * The other intention behind this is that we didn't want to add external\n * dependencies on the Autolinker utility which would increase its size. For\n * instance, adding htmlparser2 adds 125kb to the minified output file,\n * increasing its final size from 47kb to 172kb (at the time of writing). It\n * also doesn't work exactly correctly, treating the string \"<3 blah blah blah\"\n * as an HTML tag.\n *\n * Reference for HTML spec:\n *\n *     https://www.w3.org/TR/html51/syntax.html#sec-tokenization\n *\n * @param {String} html The HTML to parse\n * @param {Object} callbacks\n * @param {Function} callbacks.onOpenTag Callback function to call when an open\n *   tag is parsed.

If a self-closing\n *   tag is found, `onCloseTag` is called immediately after `onOpenTag`.\n * @param {Function} callbacks.onText Callback function to call when text (i.e\n *   not an HTML tag) is parsed.
